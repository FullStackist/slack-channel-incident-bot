# Channel-Driven Incident Management

## Manage incidents directly in Slack

This service allows you to manage incidents directly within Slack, enabling seamless interaction with incident data right inside your workspace. It integrates with Slackâ€™s API, allowing you to `Declare` incidents as they arise and `Resolve` incidents as they're handled.

## Basic Usage

Once the app is installed, you can start managing incidents directly within Slack. Here are the basic steps to get started:

1. **Declare an Incident:**
   - Type `/rootly declare <your-incident-title>` in any Slack channel to begin a new incident.
    - **A new channel is created with name `<your-incident-title>_incident` (e.g. `/rootly declare Leaky Faucet` creates channel `leakyfaucet_incident`)**
    - **To join the channel, search for it in the workspace searchbar, find it, click into it and click `join`**
    - **The created incident is now marked as `open`**
   
2. **Resolve an Incident**
   - Type `/rootly resolve` in your `<your-incident-title>_incident` channel to mark this incident as `resolved`.
    - **The time it took for the team to resolve the incident will be written to the channel**
    - **Another incident taken care of!**

3. **View all Incidents**
    - Go [here](https://slack-channel-incident-bot.onrender.com/incidents) to see a pretty display of all Incidents.
     - **Use the sorting functionality to see how the Incidents compare in terms of their different attributes**
